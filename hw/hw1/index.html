<h2>Filmography</h2>

<p>
    Thornton's first screen role was in 1988 South of Reno, where he played a small role as a counter man in a
    restaurant. He also made an appearance as a pawn store clerk in the 1987 Matlock episode "The Photographer". Another
    one of his early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom Hearts Afire and in 1989 he appeared as an
    angry heckler in Adam Sandler's debut film Going Overboard. His role as the villain in 1992's One False Move, which
    he also co-wrote, brought him to the attention of critics. He also had small roles in the 1990s films Indecent
    Proposal, On Deadly Ground, Bound by Honor, and Tombstone. He went on to write, direct, and star in the 1996
    independent film Sling Blade. The film, an expansion of the short film Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade,
    introduced the story of a mentally handicapped man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder.
